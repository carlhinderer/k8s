- Container Images

    - A 'container image' is a binary package that encapsulates all the files necessary to run a program
        inside of an OS container.

    - You can either build an image from your local filesystem or download a preexisting image from a
        'container registry'.  In either case, once the image is present on your computer, you can run
        that image to produce a running application inside an OS container.

    - The Docker image format is by far the most popular and widespread container image format.  There is
        an ongoing effort to standardize this format via the Open Container Initiative (OCI) project.

    - The Docker format is made up of a series of filesystem layers.  Each layer adds, removes, or
        modifies files from the preceding layer.  This is called an 'overlay' filesystem.


    - Containers fall into 2 main formats:

        1. System containers
             - Mimic VMs and run a full boot process
             - Often include a set of system services like ssh, cron, syslog
             - Were much more common in early days of Docker

        2. Application containers
             - Commonly run a single program
             - Provide perfect level of granularity for composing scalable applications



- Building Applications with Docker

    - For the remainder of the chapter, we'll look at building application containers.  We'll build a very
        simple Node.js application.  The simplest of Node/npm/Express apps has 2 files:

        package.json
        server.js


    - We'll put these 2 files in a directory 'app' and run:

        $ npm install express --save


    - Now, to package this up as a Docker image, create 2 more files:

        Dockerfile
        .dockerignore


    - Now we can build the image:

        $ docker build -t simple-node .


    - And we can run the image:

        $ docker build -t simple-node .
