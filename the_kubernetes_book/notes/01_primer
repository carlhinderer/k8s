- Orchestrators

    - Kubernetes is an 'application orchestrator'.  For instance, it can:

        - Deploy your application
        - Scale up and down according to demand
        - Self-heal when things break
        - Perform zero-downtime rolling updates and rollbacks



- Eras of Application Deployment

    1. Applications ran on physical servers in the age of open-system (1980s and 1990s)

    2. Applications ran on VMs in the age of VMs (2000s to early 2010s)

    3. Applications run in containers in the cloud-native era (mid 2010s to current)



- Microservices Example

    - An e-commerce application has these smaller, specialized components:

        1. Web Front-End
        2. Catalog Service
        3. Shopping Cart
        4. Authentication Service
        5. Logging Service
        6. Persistent Store



- Popular Container Runtimes

    - Docker
    - containerd
    - kata



- Kubernetes History

    - Google fell behind AWS in cloud, so they needed an abstraction layer so customers would be willing
        to switch cloud providers

    - Google had a long history of running millions of containers in Borg and Omega projects, so they
        created Kubernetes as open source project and donated to CNCF in 2014.
