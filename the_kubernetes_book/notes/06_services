- Services

    - 3 Fundamental things about k8s Services:

        1. A 'Service' is a k8s object that provides reliable and stable networking to a set of dynamic
             pods.

        2. Every service gets its own stable IP address, its own stable DNS name, and its own stable port.

        3. Services leverage labels to dynaically select pods in the cluster they will send traffic to.


    - Services have a static front end (IP, DNS name, port) and a dynamic back end (Pods are constantly
        changing).



- Labels and Label Selectors

    - For a Service to match a set of pods, and therefore send traffic to them, the Pods must possess
        every label in the Services label selector.


    - Here is an example of a label being added to a Deployment:

        deploy.yml
        ----------------------
        ...
        spec:
          replicas: 10
          selector:
            matchLabels:
              app: hello-world
          template:
            metadata:
              labels:
                app: hello-world # Pod labels
                # The label matches the Service's label selector


    - And here is an example of a Service using the label in a selector:

        svc.yml
        ---------------------
        apiVersion: v1
        kind: Service
        metadata:
          name: hello-svc
        spec:
          ports:
          - port: 8080
          selector:
            app: hello-world # Label selector
            # Service is looking for Pods with the label `app=hello-world`
